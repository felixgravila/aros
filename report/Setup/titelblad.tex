This paper describes the design and implementation process of creating an interpreter for a functional programming language designed to facilitate two-dimensional map creation and routing for the purpose of robot automation. After introducing the relevant theoretical concepts, we present the process, details and decisions related to the design and implementation of all the stages of the system.}
