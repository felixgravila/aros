\chapter{Implementation}
In this chapter, we will present the details, decisions and code that went into materialising the specifications described in \cref{chap:LanguageDesign} into a working system. We will start with our choice of implementation language and proceed with presenting the implementation of the stages of the system: Lexer, Parser, Type checker and Interpreter.
