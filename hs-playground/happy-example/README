A very simple example of how to use Alex and Happy to build a language
processor in Haskell.

To build this, you will need to install Alex and Happy. The easiest way to get
them is via Hackage:

$ cabal install alex
$ cabal install happy

#begin Felix extra info
in folder, just do `make`

to build separately, do
$ alex Tokens.x
$ happy Grammar.y

play around:
$ ghci
> :l Calc
> scanned = scanTokens "2 + 3"
> ast = parseCalc scanned
> run ast

(should output 5)


$ ghc --make Calc
#compiles Calc.hs to Calc executable

this can be run
./Calc

after writing your program, do ctrl-D to interrupt

from file:
$ echo "2 + 5" | ./Calc

or

$ cat myprogram.aros | ./Calc
